# scrappingchef
A personal repo used to scrap cooking platforms.

One django app is dedicated to scrapping an "old" platform that is not used anymore, and another app is dedicated to scrapping the "new" platform.
Another app will be dedicated to organising and accessing the content from both platforms.

This repo is made for personal use and requires multiple settings to be effective:
- login, password and url of the scrapped platform in the .env
- crx file for the video downloader extension
